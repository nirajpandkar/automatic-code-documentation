## Core Components
### Pre-add hook script

### LLM Integration Service
#### Diff Analysis Module (Identifying updates)

#### Documentation Update Handler (Updating docs)
The `DocUpdater` class is responsible for updating the documentation based on the provided diff content. It uses the `LLMService` to generate updated content and writes it back to the original documentation file.
Argument parsing has been added for the diff content, doc path, model name, and debug flag.

## Logging Configuration
The script now uses a logging configuration with a basic format and level. It also sets up a logger instance and enables debug logging if requested via the `--debug` argument.

## Documentation Update Process
The documentation update process involves reading the current documentation content, generating updated content using the LLMService, writing the updated content back to the file, and handling any exceptions that may occur during the process.
